# Password Protection Configuration
# For production/GitHub deployment, use GitHub Secrets instead of committing these:
# - Create APP_PASSWORD secret in GitHub repo Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
# - Create APP_SECRET secret in GitHub repo Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
#
# For local development, uncomment and set these values:
# APP_PASSWORD=your-secure-password-here
# APP_SECRET=your-encryption-key-here
